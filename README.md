# KinFin UI Demo

This repository is a preliminary demonstration of the **KinFin UI**, a modern web-based interface designed to visualize and interact with gene family clustering results generated by [KinFin](https://github.com/DRL/kinfin). The goal is to provide an intuitive, dynamic, and scalable frontend that integrates seamlessly with GenomeHubs platforms (e.g., MolluscDB).

> ðŸ“Œ This UI is being developed as part of a GSoC 2025 proposal under the Sanger Tree of Life program.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The KinFin UI Demo showcases:

- ðŸ§© **Wireframes and Layout Concepts**  
  Designed with flexibility and integration in mind, the UI supports dynamic data loading and modular design.

- ðŸ“Š **Visualization Planning**  
  Support for interactive charts, cluster summaries, taxon filtering, and gene attribute analysis (planned via D3.js, Recharts, MUI).


## ðŸ”® Planned Features

- Cluster visualization using interactive plots  
- Integration with GenomeHubs search results  
- Filtering and sorting by taxonomic and functional attributes  
- Export options and external resource linking (e.g., Ensembl, NCBI)  
- Real-time updates and analysis initialization from frontend
